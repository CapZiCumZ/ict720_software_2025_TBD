2) The training and testing were done on a MacBook Pro M1 w/ 16 GB of ram (2020). It used **"MPS"** instead of **"CUDA"** _(MPS - Metal Performance Shaders is the Appleâ€™s GPU-accelerated framework for deep learning)_
    
3) This project used YOLO11s, _small_ to balance model performance and training resources.
    
4) Initially, YOLO11l _(large)_ was used. The system underwent training and testing, but its size and the amount of training resources it required significantly impacted the training time.

#### Settings
1) The structure of the code consists of three parts: .py and two .yaml(s) for settings.
